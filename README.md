# Personal Website

In short, this is the source code for my personal website. It can be reached **[here](camdingman.com)**

## The Plan

To get more into the details and inspiration, I set out with a few goals for this digital space:

* **showcase** my side projects and passion for programming.
* **inspire** site viewers with knowledge gained from past projects and personal philosophies.
* **challenge** myself with an array of features. A good side project is one that you learn from.

## Addressing Goals 

### Showcase

I included a projects page, using cards to preview my different side projects. Each card includes an associated link. This link is typically to the github repo for the project. Cards also include a preview image, short description, and list of languages used in the project.
The about page provides some more personal information and background about me!

### Inspire

The home page of the website includes a blurb about my key message, *Make Coding More Fun*. This theme carries over across all pages on the site, and is used to inspire the viewer to make their own fun projects. The choice of fun colours along with the inclusion of silly features and cool animations serves to back up and put this message on display. Its not always so serious!

### Challenge

This was my first go at web development. Using React, I tried leverage components for site consistency and maintainability. Reused components include the project cards, multi-coloured text, and the puzzle piece blocks.

Some other features, intended to expand learning from this project:
* A navbar and browser router combination to create a multi-page site
    * This includes an error page for bad urls
* Scroll-triggered animation on the Home page
* A variety of buttons with unique :hover functionalities
* Images and external links

Although I thoughtfully added each of these features, the main purpose was to challenge myself in the development process. I feel confident that I gained valuable html, js, and css experience!

## Future

I plan to continue to add projects to the projects page of the site. A further step would be to embed some of the functionality of the projects into the site (i.e. make the projects easier to check out, and more interactive). Eventually, the external links will be far less important, or removed altogether.

Another goal of mine is to create spaces through which I can teach math/cs concepts, which is one of my passions. This website could be a nice spot, and there may be a new page coming in the future!

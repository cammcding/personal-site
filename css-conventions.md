# ** CSS Conventions **

This document will outline the CSS Conventions used for readability and ease  
of styling for my personal website project

### Class Names:

Each class name will specify the scope of the element, as follows:

1. General --> For use on any page
2. \[Page Name\]  --> For use on this specific page

Then it will contain some information as to what the element is/does, and  
how it should be stylized. (i.e. a general-button-small-circular)
